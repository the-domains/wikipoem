a word augustus?  
on cities and positions  
capability of technique

we are the same  
original champions  
success in superville

devices we composed in sophistry  
this particular route through memory  
our warehouses mine back rooms

methods of ariel  
hawksquill studies  
forget-me-not the mind's sireling

desirings sprayed above dubbed imagery  
from contact with einstein the words  
of augustus sink to obscure paradise
